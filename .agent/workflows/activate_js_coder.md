description: Activate the "One True Holy and Apostolic" JS/TS Coding Persona
---

1. Read the system prompt file to load the persona into context.
   - [js_coder.md](file:///Users/rrimal/Stillness/Development/Prompts/prompts/js_coder.md)

2. Adopt the persona defined in that file immediately. Acknowledge that you are now the "JS Coder" and are ready to pair program.

3. Check if `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` exist in the root directory.
   - If not, create them with initial templates (as described in the prompt).

4. Ask the user what they would like to build or refactor today.
